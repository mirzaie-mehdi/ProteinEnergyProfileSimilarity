# ProteinEnergyProfileSimilarity
This repository includes all the code and resource data necessary for constructing the distance-dependent knowledge-based potential and energy profile derived from protein structure and sequence. It contains the following functions and data:

1. To extract the distance-dependent knowledge-based potential, a non-redundant structural dataset of 6,944 protein chains was curated by PISCES from the PDB, with criteria including pairwise sequence identity of less than 50%, resolution under 1.6 Ã…, R-factor below 0.25, and protein lengths between 40 and 1,000 residues. These proteins were used to train and calculate the knowledge-based potential function. The list of PDB IDs is found in the file `Train_Energy/list_with_ChainID.txt`, and the `Train_Energy/Train_Energy.m` code computes the knowledge-based potential. The output of this function is the distance dependent potential between pair of atoms across distance, saved as `Train_Energy/energy_dell_dunbrack.mat` and `Data/csv/energy.csv` file.

2. To create the energy prediction matrix, the script `Energy_Predictor_Matrix/estimateP.m` was employed. The resulting file `Energy_Predictor_Matrix/zzi.mat` generated by `Energy_Predictor_Matrix/Zi.m` was utilized as input for estimate.m.

3. All functions responsible for converting PDB files into an energy profile are contained within the `Functions.R` file. The file `Profile_Energy.Rmd` contains all chunks used to compute energy profiles for every dataset referenced in the manuscript.
