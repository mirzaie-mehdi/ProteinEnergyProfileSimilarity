# ProteinEnergyProfileSimilarity
This repository includes all the code and resource data necessary for constructing the distance-dependent knowledge-based potential and energy profile derived from protein structure and sequence. It contains the following functions and data:

1. A non-redundant dataset of protein chains was employed to derive the distance-dependent knowledge-based potential. These protein structures served as the basis for training and calculating the potential function. The PDB IDs used are listed in the `Train_Energy/list_with_ChainID.txt` file, and the `Train_Energy/Train_Energy.m` script is used to compute the knowledge-based potential. The resulting distance-dependent potential between pairs of atoms is saved in the `Train_Energy/energy_dell_dunbrack.mat` and `Data/csv/energy.csv` files.

2. the script `Energy_Predictor_Matrix/estimateP.m` was employed to create the energy prediction matrix. The resulting file `Energy_Predictor_Matrix/zzi.mat` generated by `Energy_Predictor_Matrix/Zi.m` was utilized as input for estimate.m.

3. All the functions for converting PDB files into an energy profile are located in `Functions.R`. The `Profile_Energy.Rmd` file includes all the chunks used to compute energy profiles for each dataset mentioned in the manuscript. A brief description of each chunk is provided before its corresponding section.

    #### Note:
   To obtain the results of TM-Vec, you need to install the TM-Vec software as instructed at https://github.com/tymor22/tm-vec. The `Functions` folder contains four Python scripts that generate the TM-Vec results. For instance, you can reproduce the results for bacteriocins by running the script `tm_vec_bac.py`.

5. The file `Figures_Tables.Rmd` contains all chunks used to generate figures and tables for every dataset referenced in the manuscript.
