# ProteinEnergyProfileSimilarity
This repository includes all the code and resource data necessary for constructing the distance-dependent knowledge-based potential and energy profile derived from protein structure and sequence. It contains the following functions and data:

1. A non-redundant dataset of protein chains was employed to derive the distance-dependent knowledge-based potential. These protein structures served as the basis for training and calculating the potential function. The PDB IDs used are listed in the Train_Energy/list_with_ChainID.txt file, and the Train_Energy/Train_Energy.m script is used to compute the knowledge-based potential. The resulting distance-dependent potential between pairs of atoms is saved in the Train_Energy/energy_dell_dunbrack.mat and Data/csv/energy.csv files.

2. the script `Energy_Predictor_Matrix/estimateP.m` was employed to create the energy prediction matrix. The resulting file `Energy_Predictor_Matrix/zzi.mat` generated by `Energy_Predictor_Matrix/Zi.m` was utilized as input for estimate.m.

3. All functions responsible for converting PDB files into an energy profile are in the `Functions.R` file. The file `Profile_Energy.Rmd` contains all chunks used to compute energy profiles for every dataset referenced in the manuscript.

5. The file `Figures_Tables.Rmd` contains all chunks used to generate figures and tables for every dataset referenced in the manuscript.
